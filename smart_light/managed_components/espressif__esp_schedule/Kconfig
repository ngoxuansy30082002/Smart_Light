            Enable support for sunrise and sunset based schedules.

            This feature allows scheduling based on astronomical calculations
            for sunrise and sunset times at specific geographical locations.

            Disabling this option will:
            - Remove sunrise/sunset schedule types from the API
            - Save memory by excluding solar calculation code
            - Reduce binary size (by about 11500 bytes)

            If disabled, ESP_SCHEDULE_TYPE_SUNRISE and ESP_SCHEDULE_TYPE_SUNSET
            will not be available.
