### Hardware Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SDIO pins CMD and DAT0-3 **may require pullup resistors** depending on your hardware setup.

**Pullup Guidelines**:

- **Resistor Values**: 10kΩ to 47kΩ when needed
- **Pins**: CMD, D0, D1, D2, D3
- **Power Rail**: Connect pullups to target device's VDD (3.3V)
- **Note**: Some development boards may work without external pullups, but adding them improves signal integrity

For detailed pullup requirements, see [ESP-IDF SD Pullup Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/sd_pullup_requirements.html).

**Clock Edge Control**:

- **Sampling and Driving Clock Edge**: Based on your hardware design, you may need to configure the SDIO sampling and driving clock edge control
- **Configuration**: These settings control when data is sampled and driven relative to the clock edge
- **Hardware Dependent**: Required values depend on your specific board layout, trace lengths, and signal integrity requirements
- **Documentation**: Clock edge control details can be found in the target chip's datasheet under the Boot Configurations section

## SPI Interface

### Description

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) provides high-speed communication for loading applications directly into RAM. Supports both standard SPI and Quad-SPI modes.

### Connection Pattern

The SPI connection requires multiple pins for basic functionality:

|  Signal  |   Host Pin    |  Target Pin  | Description                       |
| :------: | :-----------: | :----------: | :-------------------------------- |
|   CLK    | Host SPI CLK  |  Target CLK  | Clock signal                      |
|    CS    |  Host SPI CS  |  Target CS   | Chip select                       |
|   MISO   | Host SPI MISO | Target MISO  | Master in, slave out              |
|   MOSI   | Host SPI MOSI | Target MOSI  | Master out, slave in              |
|  RESET   |   Host GPIO   | Target RESET | Target device reset control       |
| STRAP_B0 |   Host GPIO   | Target STRAP | Strapping bit 0 for download mode |
| STRAP_B1 |   Host GPIO   | Target STRAP | Strapping bit 1 for download mode |
| STRAP_B2 |   Host GPIO   | Target STRAP | Strapping bit 2 for download mode |

### USB Host Driver Requirements

When using ESP-IDF as host platform:

- **ESP-IDF Version**: v4.4 or newer required
- **USB Host Driver**: Must be initialized and configured
- **Task Management**: FreeRTOS task required for USB event handling
- **Device Management**: Proper connection/disconnection handling needed

## General Hardware Considerations

### Power Supply

- **Independent Power**: Each device should have its own stable power source
- **Voltage Compatibility**: Ensure matching logic levels (typically 3.3V)
- **Current Capacity**: Sufficient current for both devices during operation
- **Ground Connection**: Shared ground reference between all devices

### Signal Integrity

- **Cable Length**: Keep connections as short as practical
- **Cable Quality**: Use quality jumper cables or custom harnesses
- **Interference**: Avoid running power and signal cables in parallel
- **Termination**: Follow interface-specific requirements (e.g., SDIO pullups)

### Development Boards

- **Pin Availability**: Ensure required pins are accessible
- **Conflicting Features**: Check for onboard peripherals that might interfere
- **Reset Circuits**: Some boards have reset circuits that may affect timing
- **USB Connectors**: Verify USB connector type and power delivery capability

### Debugging Connections

Many examples support additional UART connections for debugging:

- **Separate UART**: Dedicated debug UART independent of programming interface
- **USB-to-UART Bridge**: For host platforms without direct PC connection
- **Monitor Output**: Real-time target device output during and after programming

## Troubleshooting

### Common Connection Issues

1. **No Communication**: Check power, ground, and pin assignments
2. **Intermittent Failures**: Verify cable quality and length
3. **Speed Issues**: Confirm baud rate support and cable integrity
4. **Reset Problems**: Check reset circuit and timing

### Interface-Specific Issues

- **SDIO**: Verify pullup resistors are installed and correct values
- **SPI**: Confirm strapping pins are correctly connected
- **USB**: Check power supply and USB host driver configuration
- **UART**: Verify TX/RX are not swapped
