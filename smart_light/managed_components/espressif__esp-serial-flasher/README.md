ESP Serial Flasher is a portable C library for programming and interacting with Espressif SoCs from other host microcontrollers.

## Overview

This library enables you to program Espressif SoCs from various host platforms using different communication interfaces. It provides a unified API that abstracts the underlying communication protocol, making it easy to integrate ESP device programming into your projects. In this context, the host (flashing/programming device running this library) controls the target (the ESP-series SoC being programmed). It serves a similar purpose to [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), but is designed for embedded hosts without a PC or Python runtime or on less powerful single board computers.

- **Connection and identification**: Connect to targets, autodetect chip family, read MAC address, retrieve security info.
- **Flash operations**: Write, read, erase, detect flash size, and optionally verify data via MD5.
- **RAM download and execution**: Load binaries to RAM and run them.
- **Registers and control**: Read/write registers, change transmission rate, reset the target.

### Supported Communication Interfaces

- **UART** - Universal asynchronous communication
- **USB CDC ACM** - USB virtual serial port
- **SPI** - Serial Peripheral Interface (RAM download only)
- **SDIO** - Secure Digital Input/Output (experimental)

> [!NOTE]
> SDIO interface is experimental and currently supported only with ESP32-P4 as host and ESP32-C6 as target. The implementation uses a custom stub that will be made available as part of the migration to [esp-flasher-stub](https://github.com/espressif/esp-flasher-stub).

### Supported Host Platforms (device running this library and performing flashing)

- **STM32** microcontrollers
- **Raspberry Pi** SBC
- **ESP32 series** microcontrollers
- **Zephyr OS** compatible devices
- **Raspberry Pi Pico** (RP2040)

### Public API

- Public headers: [include/esp_loader.h](include/esp_loader.h) and [include/esp_loader_io.h](include/esp_loader_io.h) define the stable public API of this library.
- Examples and helpers: [examples/common/](examples/common/) contains helper utilities used by the examples; not part of the library API, but can be used as a reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use ESP Serial Flasher, you need:

- **[CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.5 or later** - Build system
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - For cloning the repository with submodules

#### Platform Setup

Different host platforms require specific setup procedures:

- **[ESP32 series](docs/platform-setup.md#esp-idf-support)**: Works with [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/) v4.3 or later
- **[STM32](docs/platform-setup.md#stm32-setup)**: Requires [STM32 HAL libraries](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages.html) and [ARM toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain)
- **[Zephyr](docs/platform-setup.md#zephyr-setup)**: Integrates as [Zephyr](https://zephyrproject.org/) module with specific Kconfig options
- **[Raspberry Pi Pico](docs/platform-setup.md#raspberry-pi-pico-setup)**: Uses [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)
- **[Raspberry Pi](docs/platform-setup.md#raspberry-pi-setup)**: Requires [pigpio library](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/)
- **[Custom platforms](docs/supporting-new-platform.md#implementation-steps)**: ESP Serial Flasher can be used as a git submodule with your own custom platform implementation

For detailed setup instructions, see [Platform Setup Guide](docs/platform-setup.md).

For implementing custom platform support, see [Supporting New Platforms Guide](docs/supporting-new-platform.md), particularly the sections on [using ESP Serial Flasher as an external library](docs/supporting-new-platform.md#option-b-using-esp-serial-flasher-as-external-library) and [implementation steps](docs/supporting-new-platform.md#implementation-steps).

### Basic Usage

```c
#include "esp_loader.h"

esp_loader_error_t err;

// Initialize and connect
esp_loader_connect_args_t config = ESP_LOADER_CONNECT_DEFAULT();
err = esp_loader_connect(&config);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) {
    printf("Connection failed: %s\n", esp_loader_error_string(err));
    return err;
}

// Flash binary (example: 64KB at 0x10000)
const uint32_t addr = 0x10000;
const size_t size = 65536;
const size_t block_size = 4096;
// Variable holding your binary image. Typical sources:
// - Read from storage (SD card, filesystem, flash)
// - Received over a link (UART/SPI/USB/Wi‑Fi) into a RAM buffer
// - Compiled-in C array generated from a .bin
const uint8_t *data = /* pointer to your firmware image buffer */;

err = esp_loader_flash_start(addr, size, block_size);
if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;

// Write data in chunks
size_t offset = 0;
while (offset < size) {
   size_t chunk = MIN(block_size, size - offset);
   err = esp_loader_flash_write(data + offset, chunk);
   if (err != ESP_LOADER_SUCCESS) return err;
   offset += chunk;
}

esp_loader_reset_target();
return err
```

## Known Limitations

The following limitations are currently known:

- Binary image size must be known before flashing
- ESP8266 targets require `MD5_ENABLED=0` due to ROM bootloader limitations
- SPI interface only supports RAM download operations
- SDIO interface is experimental with limited platform support
- Only one target can be flashed at a time (library holds state in static variables)
- Communication interface must be selected at compile time (no runtime switching)
